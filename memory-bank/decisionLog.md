## 2025-12-29: Initial Memory Bank Setup

### Decision: Implement Memory Bank for Frontend Repository
**Context**: Multi-repository workspace requires organized documentation
**Decision**: Create dedicated memory-bank directory for frontend-specific context
**Rationale**: 
- Maintain clear separation between frontend and backend concerns
- Enable AI assistant to better understand frontend architecture
- Document frontend-specific patterns and decisions
**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Share single memory bank across both repos
- Rely on backend memory bank only
**Status**: Implemented
